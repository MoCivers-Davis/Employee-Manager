# Employee-Manager
* Command Line Employee Tracker

## Description
The Employee Manager Database is a tool that allows the user to be able to view and manage the departmens, roles, and employees in the company.  Users should be able to add departments, roles, and employees.  Users should be able to view departments, roles, and employees, and update employees as well. PLEASE NOTE that this tool is being developed in an agile environment and therefore will have several itterations before it reaches maturity.

## Technology Used
* This application is a command line interface (CLI) tool that is opperated from the command line using node.js.  In addition to node.js I used mysql workbench to build out the databases.  I also used a variety of npm packages to include mysql, inquirer and console.table as well.  

## Future Development (Ice Box)
Continue adding more functionality and features to the CLI.  Currently this CLI is bare bones and it requires a lot more functionality to become a useful tool. For instance I have to get the data when called to properly display within a user friendly format, for instance in a table view.  I also have to get the three table to join.  I know that I would likely do a left join but I ran out of time to complete this task.
